- interesting results:
  - correlation graphs & heatmaps
  - pattern distribution
  - n-gram analysis
  - other plots that you already have
- concrete examples of whitebox representation of interesting columns (similar to the ones in presentation); with calculation of compression ratio, etc.
\fi

\iffalse
To better understand the impact of \textit{whitebox compression} and how it affects the compression ratio we selected \verb|todo| representative tables and analyzed their compression trees and size components. TODO-1: analyze 2-3 tables

analyze:
YaleLanguages - very good with both vw and wc, but small
Generico - large, decent with vw, significantly good with wb
Redfin1\_1 - not good overall, but good in used -> lack of compression opportunities
RealEstate2\_1 - not good with used either
\fi
